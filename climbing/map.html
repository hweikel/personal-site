The short retaining wall at the top leads to a flat, open space above the playhouse, the first of many. Follow the ladders through the trench and keep in mind your visibility to the south. Of the many rooftops you will encounter, the final one is the most thrilling -- lost in the fog layer with the constant drone of HVAC.</h3>
