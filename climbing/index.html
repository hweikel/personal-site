					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'24.2"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'34.9"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A tall, dense fir that opens, after navigating closely set branches, to a view of Memorial Glade and the East Asian Library lattice.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'19.4"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'39.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A nice magnolia with low branches to sit out over the path and a high junction that looks over VLSB.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'19.9"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'40.9"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A tree near VLSB with smooth branches that turn sharply to the vertical six feet from the trunk. Branches part at 50', on level with the roof of Moffit, to reveal good views to the northeast and northwest.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'20.9"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'41.5"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">An established oak; climb down the wall immediately behind to access Moffit's strange basement courtyard.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'17.0"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'41.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The southeast corner of VLSB has two sizeable trees: an oak that looks into one of the larger lecture halls (2060) and a pine that sits over the large, rectangular exhaust pit in the corner. Regular cement grooves let you climb down into the pit and a thin, sloped ledge reaches the window sills horizontally.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'10.9"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'42.2"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Two rows of tall, thin aspens flank the lamps in front of the gym. They move considerably in the wind.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'16.6"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'23.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The largest oak in Faculty Glade looks north over the Last Dryad: a bronze by Alexander Stirling Calder, which sat in the inner courtyard of Hearst Gym until it was moved to the glade in 1968.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'15.0"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'20.2"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A 20' climb up either of the flanking trees gives access to the second floor balcony of Hertz Hall. Concerts can be heard within.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'19.7"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'21.7"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A long, angled branch spans the gap between two oaks, forming a path 35' over Strawberry Creek. Look down and to the south to see into the faculty club.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'18.5"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'28.4"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The tallest of a stand of ponderosa pines. After dusk, an enormous shadow of anyone climbing is cast onto the southern face of the Campanile.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'20.8"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'28.7"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A gallery of pollarded London Planes beneath the Campanile. The lowest branches of the first immediately northeast of the central sculpture can be reached from the back of the bench; another, in the southwest corner, is accessible from the marble wall. Try to circle the courtyard without touching the ground.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'20.4"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'29.9"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A magnolia stands over South Hall Road, directly across from the Bancroft Library steps. The highest junction at 45' is one of the nicest spots on campus at dusk.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'16.1"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'31.5"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A cluster of tall, thin trunks are wired together on the southeast corner of Wheeler Hall. At 40', the third story window of 220 Wheeler is within reach, or, slightly farther, the lower tier of the roof. From there, the facade and the upper roof are a short climb away. The latter looks down into the odd interior courtyard, which is accessible from the third floor, inward-facing hallway windows.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'15.5"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'32.2"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Immediately south of Wheeler's entrance is the new Wheeler Oak. The original was removed in 1934.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'15.5"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'34.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The sloping southwest corner of Wheeler has three trees. The closest to Dwinelle looks over Sproul Plaza and the hills to the east. The top of the northmost is at eye level with the roof above the fourth story and the corner offices on the way up. Behind these, walk north through the small pocket between the west wall and a long, tall line of shrubs. Where the wall indents, it's an easy climb up to the third floor ridge and from there into classrooms, or down through skylight windows at foot level into basement classrooms. A dense thicket of dead shrubs marks the other entrance to this path from the northwest corner.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'13.5"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'34.6"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Climb over the west side of Sather bridge into the first branch of the northmost oak. Descend the remaining 20' to reach the north bank of Strawberry creek. This offers access to the tunnel beneath the bridge during the rainy seasons when the sloped banks are too slippery.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'26.4"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'30.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Pull up onto the wooden beams above the outdoor cafe with the chessboards to find a small roof. The cement walls around the electrical box form a nest that looks over Memorial Glade and Hearst Mining Circle. This is likely the nicest spot on campus to sit at night, and this whole area is full of potential, from the odd little patios set down into the engineering library to the helpfully textured walls of Davis Hall.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'11.2"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'25.7"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Along the northern wall of Hearst Gym are a number of trees that look down onto the outdoor pool deck on the second story; the water is incredibly blue at night, lit from within. From the top of the westernmost tree, climb over the fence and drop onto the pool deck. Due east, the deck opens to a mezzanine that surrounds a small patio below on the first floor. The Last Dryad, now in Faculty Glade, originally sat here. A few oaks are tall enough to reach from the cement railing. Descend and exit through the northern door to the main gym hallway if unlocked; climbing back out proves more difficult.</div>
				
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'05.8"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'50.5"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Deep grooves in the cement offer easy access to Edwards Stadium right behind the circular ticket building. Across the field, the bleachers lead to a press box with roof access through a poorly secured ladder. From the top, you can see into the partially abandoned building at the corner of campus.</div>
				
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'24.7"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'21.5"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Pimentel's rooftop is at waist level from the sidewalk on University Drive. This spot gets popular after finals; stay low or you will be seen.</div>
				
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'21.8"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'22.0"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The inexplicable little Russian-looking structure behind Gilman covers a series of HVAC maintenance paths and generators: lots of amusing areas within.</div>
				
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'23.5"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'20.2"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Rooftop access from the northeast corner of the top floor of Latimer. The first door is often unlocked but the second will swing shut behind you.</div>
				
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°52'09.3"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'40.3"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Pull up onto the concrete overhang above the back door to Zellerbach. Using the grooves in the wall for leverage, stretch around the corner and up onto the playhouse roof. It's straight up from there, but starting from the roof's northeast hip makes for an easier climb; the surface itself is slippery but the metal ridges are very forgiving holds. The short retaining wall at the top leads to a flat, open space above the playhouse, the first of many. Follow the ladders through the trench and keep in mind your visibility to the south. Of the many rooftops you will encounter, the final one is the most thrilling -- lost in the fog layer with the constant drone of HVAC.</div>

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°53'04.8"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'45.9"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The hill by the Berryman Reservoir entrance to Cordonices Park has an expansive oak that leans over Euclid Avenue. The highest central branch extends over the road.</div>
				
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 37°53'48.4"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 122°15'04.6"&gt;</li>

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°56'28.9"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°11'27.7"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">The Meadows are crossed by small, named paths, dividing large sections of park into grass and playgrounds. Each path is flanked by two long, parallel rows of trees that can be climbed to around 35' on smaller paths and 60' on the largest, which is called Middle Meadow Walk. You can cross almost the whole meadow without touching the ground.</div>	
					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°55'23.4"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°11'31.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">There are two metal towers up the hill past the Royal Observatory. The first, around 30' tall, has a caged latter followed by a horizontal gate that you can climb around. The second, 40' farther up the path and down the hill to the left, is much taller but is an easy climb after getting under the fence. Look north at sunrise or sunset to see across the Firth of Forth. [Update, 2019: the first tower has been removed.]</div>	

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°57'16.4"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°10'45.1"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Down the southeastern slope of Calton Hill is a small stone wall with gates on the northwestern and southeastern ends. Use the drooping tree to the right of the latter to climb over, and a large, triangular private park lies within. All gates are locked both ways, so the same tree remains the best exit after exploring. Residents are testy.</div>	

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°55'48.2"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°10'34.5"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">At the northwest corner of the small park at Mayfield Road and West Savile Terrace, a break in the bushes opens to a metal platform that runs over the train track below.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°57'54.3"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°11'55.4"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">A long, low stand of trees line the path above the Water of Leith, looking over industrial buildings to the east and the abandoned Warriston Playing Fields to the west.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°57'43.1"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°13'04.2"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">Frozen in the winter, the lake in Inverleith Park is partially surrounded by a low hill lined with tall beech trees.</div>

					<br />

					<li class="coordinates">&lt;N 55°57'03.0"&nbsp;&nbsp;W 3°11'38.7"&gt;</li>
					<div class="caption">About 40' above the grass on the south side of the tracks is the best vantage point to watch trains entering and exiting Waverly Station .</div>
